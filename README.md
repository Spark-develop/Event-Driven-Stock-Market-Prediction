# Event-Driven-Stock-Market-Prediction 1.0

## Description

-  Project is all about a system that predicts stock prices using the events occurring day by day. Events have been extracted from the archives section of the newspapers available online. Then the extracted headlines are been divided into three parts i. e. actor, relation, and object. After some preprocessing and generation of the word vectors, these texts are sent for calculating entity relation representation to the novel neural tensor network. Further, they are processed using a deep convolutional neural network with a max-pooling layer, and the result is been concluded into two classes positive and negative.

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important! You might want to include screenshots of your code in operation. GIFS are also great!
- Just use the "![ ]()" to input images.

## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:
